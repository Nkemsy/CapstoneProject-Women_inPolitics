Women in Political Offices in Nigeria: Progress or Plateau?

Secondary Dataset used for our Capstone Project covers – (2007–2023 Analysis of Gender Representation in Nigerian General Elections)

As part of Capstone Project Group 1 under the OWEF Data Analysis and Visualization Scholars, our team conducted a comprehensive analysis of gender representation in Nigerian general elections spanning the years 2007 to 2023. The project team consisted of five members, each contributing to different aspects of the data analysis workflow.

My Role: I, Ajekwe Nkemakonam Ijeamaka, was responsible for the Excel-based data analysis. 
My key contributions included:
Setting up Power Pivot to enable seamless slicer connections across all sheets and pivot tables.
Designing and generating pivot tables for detailed data segmentation and aggregation.
Creating interactive dashboards for intuitive data visualization and stakeholder presentation.

This approach ensured consistency, interactivity, and clarity in presenting insights on gender participation trends in Nigerian elections over the 5-year period.
